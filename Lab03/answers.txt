Section 2:
I prefer using the method addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvdList) because it is
more convenient : We can add some dvds without having to create any array,just have to list
the dvds.Also, if there are many dvds, we can also pass a DigitalVideoDisc array to this method,
which is the same with method addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc [] dvdList).
Section 3:
- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD),in fact ,the program copy the references 
to the dvds to another 2 variables: jungleDVD' and cinderellaDVD', and this method only 
swaps these 2 variables, jungleDVD' and cinderellaDVD'.Therefore this swap does not effect
the origin references in the main method, so jungleDVD still points to "Jungle" DVD and
cinderellaDVD still points to "Cinderella" DVD.
- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), the program copy the 
reference to the "Jungle" DVD, jungleDVD ,to another variable,jungleDVD'.This jungleDVD' also
points to the "Jungle" DVD, so it can change the title of the DVD by using method setTitle().
Section 7:
The return type of this method should be String because the class DigitalVideoDisc is inherited
from the class Object, which has the method toString() with return type String, so the
method toString() of DigitalVideoDisc class override this method.
